### Microservices / HTTP & Websockets / Apache Kafka

*This is a thin layer which coordinates the application activity. It does not contain business logic. It does not hold the state of the business objects*

We designed and structured our [loosely coupled components](https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/tree/master/drestaurant-libs) in a modular way, 
and that enable us to choose different deployment strategy and take first step towards Microservices architectural style.

Each [microservice](https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/tree/master/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices):

 - has its own bounded context,
 - has its own JPA event(sourcing) store (we are not sharing the JPA Event Store)
 - and we distribute events between them via Apache Kafka (we do not use Kafka as event(sourcing) store)
 
#### Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform.

##### Order of events (kafka topics & partitions)

The order of events matters in our scenario (eventsourcing).
For example, we might expect that a customer is created before anything else can happen to a customer.
When using Kafka, you can preserve the order of those events by putting them all in the same Kafka **partition**.
They must be in the same Kafka **topic** because different topics mean different partitions.

We [configured our Kafka instance](https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/blob/master/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices/docker-compose.yml) to crate only one topic (**axon-events**) with one partition initially.
 
##### Queue vs publish-subscribe (kafka groups)

If all consumers are from the same group, the Kafka model functions as a traditional **message queue** would.
All the records and processing is then load balanced.
**Each message would be consumed by one consumer of the group only.**
Each partition is connected to at most one consumer from a group.
 
When multiple consumer groups exist, the flow of the data consumption model aligns with the traditional **publish-subscribe** model.
**The messages are broadcast to all consumer groups.**

We [configured our (micro)services](https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/blob/master/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices/drestaurant-microservices-command-customer/src/main/resources/application.yml) to use publish-subscribe model, by setting unique consumer group id for each (micro)service.

 
#### 'Command' HTTP API

##### Create new Restaurant
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '{
  "menuItems": [
    {
      "id": "id1",
      "name": "name1",
      "price": 100
    }
  ],
  "name": "Fancy"
}' 'http://localhost:8084/api/command/restaurant/createcommand'
```
##### Create/Register new Customer
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '{
  "firstName": "Ivan",
  "lastName": "Dugalic",
  "orderLimit": 1000
}' 'http://localhost:8082/api/command/customer/createcommand'
```
##### Create/Hire new Courier
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "maxNumberOfActiveOrders": 20
}' 'http://localhost:8081/api/command/courier/createcommand'
```
##### Create/Place the Order
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '{
  "customerId": "CUSTOMER_ID",
  "orderItems": [
    {
      "id": "id1",
      "name": "name1",
      "price": 100,
      "quantity": 0
    }
  ],
  "restaurantId": "RESTAURANT_ID"
}' 'http://localhost:8083/api/command/order/createcommand'
```
Note: Replace CUSTOMER_ID and RESTAURANT_ID with concrete values.

##### Restaurant marks the Order as prepared
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' 'http://localhost:8084/api/command/restaurant/order/RESTAURANT_ORDER_ID/markpreparedcommand'

```
Note: Replace RESTAURANT_ORDER_ID with concrete value.

##### Courier takes/claims the Order that is ready for delivery (prepared)
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' 'http://localhost:8081/api/command/courier/COURIER_ID/order/COURIER_ORDER_ID/assigncommand'

```
Note: Replace COURIER_ID and COURIER_ORDER_ID with concrete values.

##### Courier marks the Order as delivered
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' 'http://localhost:8081/api/command/courier/order/COURIER_ORDER_ID/markdeliveredcommand'

```

#### 'Query' HTTP API
Application is using an event handlers to subscribe to interested domain events. Events are materialized in SQL database schema and distributed over Apache Kafka

HTTP/REST API for browsing the materialized data:

```
curl http://localhost:8085/api/query
```


## Development

This project is driven using [Maven][mvn].

### Clone

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant
```

### Build

```bash
$ cd digital-restaurant
$ mvn clean install
```


### Run microservices

NOTE: Docker is required. We use it to start Apache Kafka with Zookeeper

```bash
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices
$ docker-compose up -d
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices/drestaurant-microservices-command-courier
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices/drestaurant-microservices-command-customer
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices/drestaurant-microservices-command-restaurant
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices/drestaurant-microservices-command-order
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices/drestaurant-microservices-query
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```


## Continuous delivery

We have one deployment pipeline for all applications and libraries within this repository. In addition, all projects in the repository share the same dependencies. Hence, there are no version conflicts because everyone has to use the same/the latest (SNAPSHOTS) version. And you don't need to deal with a private NPM (JavaScript) or Maven (Java) registry when you just want to use your own libraries.
This setup and project structure is usually addressed as a [monorepo](https://medium.com/@maoberlehner/monorepos-in-the-wild-33c6eb246cb9).
